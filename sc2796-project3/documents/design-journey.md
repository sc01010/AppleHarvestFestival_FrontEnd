# Project 3: Design Journey

**For milestones, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either.

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combination, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Project 1 or Project 2
> Which project will you add a form to?

I will be adding my form to my Project 2.


## Audience (Milestone 1)
> Who is your site's target audience? This should be the original audience from Project 1 or Project 2. You may adjust the audience if necessary. Just make sure you explain your rationale for doing so here.

My site's target audience are students who are planning on touring colleges in the Ithaca Area with their family, because as the students are touring the Ithaca Area, they can plan their trip accordingly, so that they can also attend the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival to can a feel of what the Ithaca area is like. Helping high schoolers get a feel of the Ithaca area will also help them decide whether they would like to spend the next four years in the Ithaca Area.
*This is my original audience from project 2.


## Audience's Needs (Milestone 1)
> List the audience's needs that you identified in Project 1 or 2. Just list each need. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc. You may adjust the needs if necessary. However, any changes you make to the needs for this project should be clearly identified and justified.

- One of my audiences' needs is to know how to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.
- Another one of my audiences' needs is to know what they can buy at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so they can plan ahead of time the things that they may buy
- My intended audience also need to know about parking in the greater Ithaca area because most/if not all of my intended audience are coming from places where they are going to be driving to the Ithaca Area, so it would be very helpful for them to know the details about parking in the greater Ithaca area.
- My audience also needs to be able to keep up with the latest information about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival
- My audience also needs information about the T-CAT bus service in case they would like to experience the local bus transportation system
- My audience need to know the activities that they can do at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, so they can plan their time accordingly.


## HTML Form + User Needs Brainstorming (Milestone 1)
> Using the audience needs you identified, brainstorm possible options for an HTML form for the site. List each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the HTML form addresses that need.

- One possible form can be a pre-order form. Since one of the need that I have identified is that the user need to be able to know what they can buy at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, it would be very convenient for them if they could just pre-order the things that they want and just pick up the items when they are departing from the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.
- Another possible form can be the feedback form (this is suggested in the project 3 online write-up). Since my user is partaking in the Ithaca Harvest Festival, because they wanted to experience what the greater Ithaca area is like, it would be great for the users to be able to provide feedback on how their experience was like, so that in the future adjustments can be made accordingly so that future visitors can have a better experience.
- There can also be a form for prize/raffle in order to attract more people to attend the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival (this is suggested in the project 3 online write-up). Since the users are attending the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival already, the raffle/prize can be an additional activity at the end of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival to encourage my users to stay at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival for a longer amount of time.
- One more possible form can be a form where users request for performers to attend the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival (this is similar to the form that was recommended on the project 3 write-up). Users can request for performers that they want to see at the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and we can send emails to try to invite performers to come to attend the festival. If the performers accept our invitation, we can possible increase the attendence of the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and this could help the local farmers because they can sell more of their products.


## HTML Form Proposal & Rationale (Milestone 1)
> Make a decision about your site's form. Describe the purpose of your proposed form for your Project 1 or 2 site. Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed form meets the needs of your site's audience.
> Note: If your form is a contact form, we expect to see a thorough justification explaining how a contact form addresses the user's _actual_ needs. In your justification explain how a contact form better suits the needs of your user compared to the alternatives (e.g. sending you an email using your email address).

Form Proposal: I am deciding to make a feedback form so that my users can provide feedback on their experience attending the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

User Needs Rational: The reason that I am going to make a feedback form is so that I can gather information about how the user felt about the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival and what it was during the festival that made the user feel a certain way so that in the future. I will be able to user the information that I have gathered in the form to improve the user experience for future Ithaca Apple Harvest Festivals. I will be able to know what went well for the user and what did not go well for the user. This could also be a way for the user to rant so that they do not hold in the frustrations that they felt during the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival(if they felt any at all). For instance if many of my users denote in the feedback form that they had a negative experience with a certain booth vendor, then it is important that the administrative team to flag the vendor and contact the user to follow up with more detail, so we can in turn get in contact with the specific vendor and get things sorted out so that the future audience does not face the same problems. Another need of my users is to be able to express what they would like to see again in the next Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, specifically my audience need to have a way to express what it was about this specific Apple Harvest Festival that they liked, and that would attract them to attending a future Apple Harvest Festival. The users know that the administration would want to retain their attendees and they want to be able to express to the administration how they can go about attracting them to come back to the festival, and it is one of their needs to be able to provide this feedback easily to the administration. The user does not want to have to fill out paper feedback forms because not only is it not environment friendly, but it is also a hassle to physically hold onto a form and it is even more of a hassle to remember to turn in the form. My online feedback form would eliminate all of the anxieties and hassles that hinder's my user's need of providing feedback. The user wants the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival to improve so that it becomes something that they want to look forward to attending. Things such as being able to easily arrive at the festival in a timely fashion is also very important, so I included the form componenet that asks for the mode of transportation of my audience, so I know that if hypothetically most of my audience arrive by cars, then the administrative team can think up idea on how to lessen traffic and increase parking in the area to accomendate my users who are arriving by cars. In a sense it is important the that users feel that their needs are met by having a place where they can express their needs and this is the ultimate purpose of the feedback form. The users want to have a better time at the festival and in turn they need to have a place where they can voice what they think that the curator of the festival needs to do to improve experiences that the audience have at the festival. For example, if a lot of the users came with their family with children, then that provides insight for the administration that we need to provide more events that serve families with kids in order to meet their needs. It is through these feedback forms that the curators of the festival can find ways to meet the needs of all of the audience. The form component that asks about the amount of booth attended and the feedback on those booths would provide insight as to which booths the audience enjoyed and would like to see again in future festival and which booths that the majority of the audience did not have a positive experience with and should not be brought back. The ckeckboxes that highlight the different activities that the audience partook in would allow the administration to find out which activities the audience most enjoyed and which activities the administration should bring back. The administration can also go about finding other activities that are similar to the popular activities to tailor the activities to the needs of the audience. In the end, the audience wants to have a good time, and it is one of their needs to be able to provide feedback about what went well, so that in the future events they can continue to enjoyed the things that made the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival enjoyable for them.

## Form User Data (Milestone 1)
> Think through and plan the data you need to collect from the users. Do you need their name? Email address? etc.

- Name (so I know which user provided the feedback, to make sure that it is not just a prankster)
- Email (so I can potentially follow up with the user if they stated anything extreme)
- How did they communte to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival(This will allow us to gather information about how we can go about providing more information on how to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival for future attendees)
- The amount of people that came with my user (to gather information about whether people were more likely to come with other people or to just come by themselves)
- The booths that the users attended and their experience with the booths
- The activities that the users partook in and their experiences with the activities
- The items that they have purchased during the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival


## Form Components & Validation Criteria (Milestone 1)
> For each piece of data you plan to collect from the users, identify an appropriate HTML component to collect that data and decide the validation criteria (e.g. whether this data is _required_). Briefly explain your reasoning for the component choice and the validation criteria.

- Name (required): text field; `<input type="text">`'
- The name data is required because it would be helpful if we know that it is a actual person who filled out the form and not just a bot. Additionally, if we ever need to contact the user it would be very important if we could respectfully address our audience properly.
- The reason why I chose a text field component because in Professor Harms' videos and during the Lab sections, we learned that since names are typically going to be one line long, it would only make sense that we use a textbox that would fit one line of text. In the demonstrations, the type=text was used and that is the reason why I am selecting this component. The validation criteria is that the field is not empty, because as stated above, we need to collect the user's name.

- Email (required): text field; `<input type="email">`
- The email data is required because if the user presented extreme frustration in their feedback on their experience, it would be helpful to both the user and the organizer of the festival if we call and follow up with the user.
- In Professor Harms' videos and during the Lab sections, we were taught that there are many componets that we could use for email, but the input element has a specific value for the attribute type for collecting email data and that is the reason why I am choosing this component. The validation criteria for this component is that the input resembles that of the typical email, and this is because we don't just want the user to be inputing the wrong type of imformation into the email component.

- Primary Modes of Transportation: drop-down list `<select>`
- The mode of transportation data is required because it would be very helpful to gather information about how users arrived at the festival, because we can figure out whether we need to clear up more parking space for the users, or to include more information about the bus routes to the festival or the different routes that the users can use to walk to the festival in the future.
- The reason why I am selecting a drop down list for this component is because I want to collect information about the most frequent type of transportation that is used to get to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival. I have preselected the most frequent type of transportation that the users would use, and I chose a drop down list so that the user would not select random answer that would not give me important data about the mode of transportation that is most frequently used. The data that we collect can be used to improve traffic for the next Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, and the preselected options contribute most to traffic.

- Amount of Attendees: number field; `<input type="number">`
- The amount of attendees data is required because this allows us to gather information about whether people are more likely to come with their families and friends, or by themselves. This will allow us to plan out events in the future that gears toward the majority of the people that comes to the festival.
- In Professor Harms' videos and during the Lab sections, we learned that there is a specific value for the attribute type in the input element that would allow us to specify that the user selects a number and this was the basis to why I chose this componenet choice. I chose the validation requirement that the input has to be a number because it is makes sense that you can only pick a number to represent the number of people that arrived with you to the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival.

- Experience with different booths: textarea; `<textarea>`
- This data is required because the whole point for this form is for the users to be able to provide feedback about their experience at the Apple Harvest Festival. We want to know what they felt during the festival and why they experienced those emotions during their attendence of the festival.
- I chose the component textarea for collecting the data about the experiences that my users had with the Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival, because I wanted the user to write in words how their experience was at the festival. I wanted the users to express any of their emotions and why they felt those emotions. I chose for the validation requirement for the length of the input to be greater than 0 because I want the user to write a feedback that is at least a sentence long, but a sentence can be any length, and we did not learn enough JavaScript to be able to calculate the length of a sentence, so I just stuck with the requirement that at the length of the input is not 0 (the user has to enter at least one character).

- Activities Participation: checkbox; checkbox; `input type="checkbox">`
- This data is required because this allows us to get information about which activies are most popular so we can be sure to include them in future Ithaca Apple Harvest Festivals. We can use the information that we gathered about the activities to get future futures activities that are similar to the popular activities.
-The reason why I chose to have a check box for collecting data about the activities that the audience partook in, is because there is a set list of valid activities that I would like to audience to choose from. It would not be helpful if the audience all gave me answers that were written in all kinds of ways, so I decided to preselect the answers using check boxes. I chose checkboxes over radio buttons, because you can only select one option for radio buttons, but you can select many options with checkboxes. The validation requirement for this component is that at least one component is checkoff, because the administrative team value the information about which activities were most popular among the audience. The activities also indicate whether the audience actually partook in the festival, because there are so many live performances everywhere that in the very least the live performances should be checked off by the user (there will also be a live performance right at the entrance of the festival, so you would see the live performance right as you enter the festival). This would also sort of indicate whether the forms was checked off by someone random/bot or it was actually checked off by one of the audiences that acutually partook in the festival.

## Form Location (Milestone 1)
> Which HTML file will you place your form?

My form is going to be in (feedback.html). This is a new html file, because as I was thinking about the placement of the form, it made the most sense to have the form to have its own webpage. The contents of the form are different from the contents on the other webpages and does not necessarily "fit in." The feedback.html webpage is dedicated to the form.

> Sketch the location of the form in that page. This sketch need not be fancy. You don't need to provide many details of the page or form. Just plan the location of the form on the page and communicate that to us. You can literally have a box that says "FORM HERE."

**Desktop Location**

## Form Implementation Planning (Milestone 1)
> What submission method will your form use? GET or POST. Explain your reasoning.

I am going to be using the submission method of POST because the users are going to be submitting sensitive information in the form, such as their email address and their name, so I am going to need to use POST to not include their personal information in the link that gets sent to the server.

> For your site's `<form>` element, plan all HTML attributes that you will need and their values. Hint: action=, method=, novalidate

- `method="POST"`
- `action=""https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1300/2020fa/submit.php""`
- novalidate

**New Versions of Sketches(*I created this part)**
In the instruction, we are told that our finalized iterations of our website need to matched the finalized sketches, and I have included the new iterations of the sketches of my website below (the finalized version of my website):
*After I sketched out the finalized version of my website, I then went about coding up the website. 
*Please note that I did not include any sketches for the tablet version, because in the instructions we were only told to include our mobile and desktop verions of our website. My tablet version is basically the exact same as my mobile version because the way that the contents were displayed made sense for the tablet version to mimic everything the the mobile version. Please reference the mobile sketches if you would like to see how the tablet version is supposed to look like. Since we were not explicitly instructed to include sketches for the tablet version, I did not include any additional sketches. I did plan before coding my tablet version of my website by referencing the mobile sketches, since ahead of time I have decided to base the tablet version of my website on the mobile version.

**Desktop**

## Additional Information (Milestone 1)
> (optional) Include any additional information, justifications, or comments we should be aware of.

I do not have any addtional information, justifications, or comments.
Can you please provide some feedback about my checkbox(This is my first time using checkboxes and I am not sure if the checkboxes are properly aligned on the desktop and mobile version)? Thank you very much.


## Plan Validation Pseudocode (Final Submission)
> Write your form validation pseudocode here.

```

  If the name component data is valid:
    Hide the name feedback message
  else:
    Show the name feedback message (Please enter your full name)
  If the email component data is valid:
    Hide the email feedback message
  else:
    Show the email feedback message (Please enter your email address)
  If primary mode of tranportation component data is valid:
    Hide the primary mode of transportation feedback messsage
  else:
    Show the primary mode of transportation feedback message (Please select how you arrived at the festival)
  If the attendee component data is valid:
    Hide the attendee feedback message
  else:
    Show the attendee feedback message (Please select the number of visitors (including yourself))
  If the experience component data is valid:
    Hide the activities feedback message
  else:
    Show the experience feedback message (Please share your experiences at the festival today)
  If the activities feedback component data is valid:
    Hide the activities feedback message
  else:
    Show the activities feedback message (Please select the activities that you participated in)
  If the form data is valid (all of the components have valid inputs/no error messages):
    Send data(all of the inputs) to the server
  else:
    Do not submit the form/send the form to the server
```


## Additional Design Justifications (Final Submission)
> If you feel like you haven’t fully explained your design choices in the final submission, or you want to explain some functions in your site (e.g., if you feel like you make a special design choice which might not meet the final requirement), you can use the additional design justifications to justify your design choices. Remember, this is place for you to justify your design choices which you haven’t covered in the design journey. Use it wisely. However, you don’t need to fill out this section if you think all design choices have been well explained in the final submission design journey.

In my form componenets, there were two places where I had to reference data from another source, in order to validate the information of the form. The reason why I had to do some research instead of just using the snippet that Professor Harms have provided is because in the reference guide that Professor Harms have provided, I could not find the jquery code for validating drop down list and for validating textarea. For my down down list, I wanted the user to not select the default option, which I have purposefully made the default option a statement for the user to select another option, but in the snippets that were provided to us by Professor Harms, I did not see a snippet of code that would allow me to detect if the default option is selected or if a new option is selected. This led me to have to look up how to do this. Ultimately I had to use what Professor Harms had taught us with in his lecture along with the new found information that I came across to create this solution (I referened the webpage where I came across this information by using comments). In addition to the drop down list, I also had to figure out a way to see if the user inputed any information in the textarea. I did not find any snippets for this in the reference guide that Professor Harms have provided us, so again I had to go online to try to find information on how to do this. I again referenced the information that I found online by using comments. Additionally, I again used the information that Professor Harms have provided for us. In both of the cases, I used the general structure that Professor Harms has taught in both in class and in his videos. All I had to do was learn how to alter the condition for the if statement in order to match what I was trying to validate in order to complete my validation.js file. In class Professor Harms also taught us that if all of the components on the form was required, then we did not need to use the asterisks to specify which components are required and which ones are not because every single component is required. This is the reason why I went back to my form to delete all of the asterisks(reference my orginal sketches to see what my design would have been like with asterisks). I have also included new sketches to match the final design of my web page. Going back to the 2 components where I had to reference outside information, for the mode of transportation component, I learned that all I had to do was check the value of the selected component and make sure that it is not the same as the dafault value, and this took care of that form component. For the text area component, I learned that I needed to check for the input length and that as long as the length of the input is not 0(if the length of the input is not 0, then it means that the textarea input was not left empty), then the form component is valid.


## Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you coded some JavaScript. What did you learn from this experience?

There are so many things that I learned during this project. I have never coded in JavaScript before, this was a new experience for me. The first thing that I learned about JavaScript is that the purpose of JavaScript is to include interactivity into our website. I learned that HTML is for coding up semantic meaning, and CSS is for styling up our website, and lastly JavaScript is for including interactivity in our website. I learned that we always have to include our JavaScript in a different file and it needs to be located in our scripts folder. Professor Harms also taught us that we need to first reference our JavaScript file in our HTML file just like how we reference our CSS file. I also learned about the importance of adding the async attribute when we reference our JavaScript file. In addition, I also learned a lot about using jQuery and how it is connected to JavaScript. The whole process of learning how to use JavaScript and jQuery through practicing with form validation gave me a lot of experience with working with JavaScript and jQuery, even though I did not get the chance to write up JavaScript and jQuery code from scratch, I still learned a lot about the structure of the code and how we can go about using interactivity to alter the information that we had already written up using HTML. I was really fascinated by the fact that all we had to do was add and remove a class value from a class that is connected to a certain id, in order to make our error messages appear and disappear. At first, I thought that the code was going to be a lot more complex for us hide and show information based on how our user interacts with our website. Professor Harm's demonstration was really interesting and it taught me a lot of things, such as how we need to make sure that the snippets are used properly for our interactivity to work. I also learned a lot about debugging using the console during this project. I had a lot of trouble to get my code to work and it was really frustrating, but using the console and incrementally verifying my work with the console really helped me to be able to get through all of the huddles that I faced.


> Reflect on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together support client-side interactivity. If it's helpful, you can describe your mental model of client-side interactivity or explain how the general idea of showing and hiding content can be used to implement other forms of client-side interactivity beyond form validation and feedback.

Professor Harms taught us that HTML is used for us to code semantic meaning. We are not supposed to include any styling or interactivity using HTML because we are taught that it is good practice to keep all of the semantic meaning, style, and interactivity separately. Professor Harms taught us that we need to include all of the content in the HTML file and then we can use CSS and JavaScript to change the content depending on how our user interacts with our website. We are taught that it is good practice to use CSS to style up our webpages. In this project specifically, we used CSS to hide all of our content by default. Not only can we use CSS to just hide content, but we can also change the way that the content is displayed. In the interactivity layer is where we use JavaScript to write up code where different events trigger different changes to our web page. In this project, our objective was to add a form to either our project 1 or our project 2 and the goal was to hide or show our custom feedback messages depending on the information that the user typed into the components of our form. The event that trigger the hiding or the showing of our feedback messages is when the user submits the form (when the user presses on the submit button, but Professor Harms taught us that it is more formal to say that when the user submits the form). It was through adding or remove the "hidden" class that we achieve hiding or showing our feedback messages. We learned in class that using JavaScript does not limit us to only hiding or showing feedback messages (content) but there are a lot of other things that we can do about the appearence of our content. Ultimately, all three parts: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript had to work together in order for our form to work the way that we expect it to. My current mental model, that was developed from attending class and watching Professor Harms' videos is that when the HTML loads in our brower, our browser creates a DOM tree representation of our HTML file, and it makes changes only to the DOM tree model and not in the original source HTML. There are different nodes in the DOM tree and in those nodes, there are already CSS files and JavaScript files, and it is waiting for the user to interact with our web page to create an event that will act as a trigger for our JavaScript code. By utilizing different CSS codes that we have written, we can make cans to the appearence of our web page far beyond just validation and feedback. We can potentially also alter the theme of our website through client-side interactivity. When the user interacts with our web page in a specific way, change the background colors and the topography of the content of our web page, such as altering the font-colors and font-size. In Professor Harms' live class and in his videos, he taught us that the idea of showing and hiding content can also be applied to modal image, which is where when we click on a image, an enlarged version of the image shows up, and Professor Harms mentioned that we can achieve this by having two versions of an image, and we would hide the larger version of the image by default. When the user clicks on the smaller version of the image, then the larger of the image would show and the smaller version of the image would hide. The general of concept of hiding and showing images that we learned from class is really useful in the sense that all of the content is already in our HTML page, but as the user interacts with our website in different ways, different content hides and shows and this creates the illusion that our contents are actually changing, but behind the scenes everything is already set in stone. Professor Harms mentioned in class that he wants us to gain experience with using JavaScript and jQuery so he has decided that we would do form validation with feedback to practice our skills with showing and hiding content in this manner.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

Upon closer reflection there are so many things that I have learned since the start of the class. I came into this class with no background knowledge about front end programming or client side development, and over the course of this class I learned so much. I think that my biggest take away from this class is the ability to plan first before coding. I learned that things work out a lot better when I first take out the time to think about how I want my website to look like and all of the content that I want on my website before coding everything up. Things like card sorting and sketching out my website really helped me as I was planning our my website, because I realized that as I was planning out my website, there were so many details that I would not have thought about if I just decided to code out my website without first mapping everything out. Through the 3 projects, I realized that I gained a lot of experience especially with using HTML, because in all of the three projects we utilized HTML. I also realized that I gained a lot of experience with CSS from the three projects because in all three projects we worked with CSS to style up our website. In project 2, I learned how to use media queries in order to create a  responsive for the wide range of screen sizes that my user may be using to access my website. Lastly, in this project, I learned how to use JavaScript and jQuery to implement interactivity into my website, so that when my audience uses my website, they can interact with my website. Specifically in the third project I learned how to create form validations with custom error messages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started out this third project with no background knowledge about JavaScript and jQuery to being able to create my form with the form validation, and now that I think about it, it does seem pretty impressive that I learned so much in such a short amount of time. In the lecture that covered the information that allowed me to complete this project (project 3), I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interacts with each other in order to create a website that is interactive. Professor Harms mentioned in the first days of class that in this class we are going to be learning how to implement static website, and thinking all the way back to the beginning of the course, I did not quite think that I would be able to all of the things that Professor Harms mentioned that we were going to be doing in this class, and now that I have reach this point of the course, I think that there were so much things that I have learned, but at the same time there is still so much things that I have yet to learn. After taking this course, I realized that I would like to learn more about JavaScript and I realized that I would also like to learn about backend programming even though I have no knowledge about backend programming. I also realized that I would like to learn what a dynamic website is and how it differs from  a static website.
